# Deployment of 1D-CNN for Hyperspectral Image Segmentation

This GitHub repository serves as the supplementary material for the paper titled *In-Orbit Deployment of 1D-CNN for Hyperspectral Image Segmentation for Optimal Satellite Operations*, authored by Jon Alvarez Justo, Dennis D.Langer, Simen Berg, Jens Nieke, Radu Tudor Ionescu, Per Gunnar Kjeldsberg, and Tor Arne Johansen. You can access the full article by clicking ///HERE///. This work implements, tests, and deploys the 1D-CNN named 1D-Justo-LiuNet in orbit. 

Overview of supplementary material: 
* main_for_inference.c: includes the C functions for the layers used in 1D-Justo-LiuNet.
* Further segmented images for around 300 hyperspectral data captures can be found HERE [//// ADD LINK ////].
* The Keras model for 1D-Justo-LiuNet can be found in our GitHub repository [HERE](https://github.com/NTNU-SmallSat-Lab/s_l_c_segm_hyp_img/).
* The HYPSO-1 Sea-Land-Cloud-Labeled Dataset is available for download [HERE](https://ntnu-smallsat-lab.github.io/hypso1_sea_land_clouds_dataset/).
